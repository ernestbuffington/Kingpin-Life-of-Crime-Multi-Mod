Kingpin is based on Quake2, and like Quake2, it has several bugs and security
issues. Quake2 has since been made open source, and enhanced Quake2 servers
have appeared. R1Q2 is one of the main ones, and kpded2 is a version of it that
has been modified to run Kingpin instead of Quake2. kpded2 is fully compatible
with the original Kingpin server, so it can simply be dropped in place of the
kingpin/kpded executable without any config changes, although you will probably
want to edit your config to take advantage of new features.

As well as fixing bugs and security holes, kpded2 adds a bunch of other
improvements, including the following:

* A workaround for the Kingpin client's broken download support, to allow
  sounds and skies to be downloaded from the server. PAK files and other
  Game DLL specific files can also be downloaded from the server.

* Reduced bandwidth, memory and CPU usage. Practically 0% CPU usage when idle
  mode is enabled by the Game DLL or config.

* Packet loss measurement and duplicate packet sending to reduce it.

* Message buffering to prevent overflows.

* Player country lookups using MaxMind GeoIP2 database.

* Demo recording.

* Support for team info in server browsers.

* A new console window with command history on Windows ("-oldconsole" can be
  used in the command-line to enable the old style console window).

* A bunch of new config options and commands (see below).


Quick start settings
====================
Here are some suggested settings to start with in your server config:

set sv_bandwidth xxx    (replace 'xxx' with a value below your upstream speed)
set sv_enforcetime_kick 4
set sv_maxpps 120

If you have a slow hard drive (not SSD), also enable download precaching:

set sv_download_precache 1

When running a mod that doesn't require any special client files (eg. PAKs),
clients should be told to use their 'main' directory to avoid duplicate files
in multiple directories:

set clientdir main

When running an old mod without its own connection or name notifications, the
following may be used:

set sv_show_connections 1
set sv_show_name_changes 1

On Windows, the default network buffers are very small, so they should be
increased:

set net_rcvbuf 64
set net_sndbuf 64

Also on Windows, if other software (including other servers) is running on the
same machine, the Kingpin server may be given higher CPU priority when it is in
use:

set win_priority auto

See the descriptions below for what these settings do.

On Linux, all files and directories should be lowercase. The 'fixfilenames'
command can be used to fix any such issues. When using the unzip program to
install files, its -LL option can be used to have it convert to lowercase.


Server config options
=====================
As well as the standard Kingpin config options, the following new options can
be used:

allow_download_paks
  Allow downloading of PAK files in the game directory (not main). Default 1.

allow_download_pics
  Allow downloading of files in the pics directory. Default 1.

clientdir
  Client-side "game" value. This allows the server to use a custom directory
  while the client uses the normal directory. Default is the server's "game"
  value.

con_filterlevel
  Bitmask of message types to exclude from the console. Default 0.
    2: SERVER
    4: DEBUG
    8: WARNING
    16: ERROR
    32: GAME
    128: NAME
    256: DROP
    1024: EXPLOIT

    8192: CHAT
    16384: NET
    32768: GAMEDEBUG

  Limited rcon password for use with lrcon commands. Default empty.

net_ignore_icmp
  Don't use ICMP destination-unreachable messages to detect and kick clients
  with lost connections. Default 0.

net_rcvbuf

  results in much greater bandwidth usage. Default 0.

  'completely invalid', not 'fails the check condition').

packetdup
  Request duplicates of each frame to be sent when there is any packet loss.
  If n is omitted, then the client's current setting is shown. Also see
  sv_max_packetdup.
    Syntax : packetdup [n]


Client cursing disabling
========================
A client that has parental control active will not hear cursing sounds when
playing a mod that has cursing ability, and other clients won't hear any
cursing sounds from them if they happen to try the cursing feature themself.
This can also be enabled without parental control by adding "set nocurse 1" to
the autoexec.cfg file.

Besides not wanting to hear cursing sounds, another possible reason to do this
is to avoid a possible stutter when a curse sound is first loaded from a slow
hard drive (not SSD).


Map override files
==================
Map override files allow modification of entities in existing maps without
requiring any client-side downloads or support. For example, they can be used
to add and remove weapons/ammo/spawnpoints, or convert a DM map into a bagman
(or other game mode) map.

The 'dumpents' command can be used to export an existing map's entities to a
file, which you can then modify as wanted in a text editor. The file's
extension must be '.bsp.override', and it must also contain the original map's
name in a first line comment (added automatically by the 'dumpents' command).

An override file can have the same name as the original map (just '.override'
added) to always use the modified entities with that map, or it can have a
different name. For example, if you want a separate version of kpdm1 without a
flamer then you might name the file 'kpdm1-noflamer.bsp.override'.


Game DLL updating
=================
The game DLL can be updated without stopping the server by appending '.new' to
the new file's name (eg. gamex86.dll.new). It will then replace the existing
DLL upon the next reload, which can be triggered by the 'map' command or the
'sv_recycle' option.
